### Intelligent Reporting System

The driver features an advanced threshold-based reporting system that prevents log spam while ensuring important changes are captured:

#### Threshold-Based Reporting
- **Smart Filtering**: Only reports sensor changes that exceed configurable thresholds
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Individual threshold settings for each sensor type
- **Maximum Interval**: Guarantees at least one report every 30 minutes (configurable)
- **Event Indicators**: Clear suffixes show why each event was reported:
  - `[MaxReportingInterval]` - Reported due to time elapsed
  - `[Refresh]` - Reported due to manual refresh command

#### Benefits
- **Reduced Log Spam**: Eliminates unnecessary frequent updates
- **Important Changes Captured**: Significant sensor changes are always reported
- **Guaranteed Updates**: Maximum interval ensures regular status updates
